# Complete Debug Logging Cleanup

## Problem
The application was producing constant debug output during runtime, making it difficult to use and cluttering the terminal with excessive messages.

## Sources of Debug Output Removed

### 1. Input Handler (`input_handler.c`)
**Key press logging** - Commented out printf statements for:
- Number keys (1, 2, 3, 4) - "Key X pressed (select corner X)"
- Toggle keys (C, B, H) - "Toggle X highlights"  
- Action keys (R, P) - "R key pressed (reset keystone)", "P key pressed (save keystone)"
- Arrow keys - "Up/Down/Left/Right arrow pressed"

### 2. Video Player Main Loop (`video_player.c`)  
**Per-frame debug messages** - Commented out printf statements that were printing every frame:
- "No corner selected, clearing arrow key states"
- "Corner X selected, preserving arrow key states"

### 3. Keystone Matrix Calculations (`keystone.c`)
**Warning messages** - Commented out printf statements for mathematical edge cases:
- "Warning: Near-singular matrix encountered in keystone calculation"
- "Warning: Potentially unstable keystone solution" 
- "Warning: Clamping extreme value in keystone matrix"
- "Warning: Near-degenerate keystone configuration detected"
- "Invalid keystone configuration prevented (area too small)"

## What's Still Logged

**Essential messages kept for user feedback:**
- Initialization messages (device detection, input mode selection)
- Quit requests ("Quit requested")
- Critical errors (setup failures)
- Video decoder status messages
- Performance timing information (if enabled)

## Impact

The application now runs quietly during normal operation while preserving:
- All functionality (keystone controls, video playback, etc.)
- Essential error reporting
- User feedback for important actions

## Testing

Run the application - it should now operate with minimal console output:
```bash
./pickle /path/to/video.mp4
```

The keystone corner adjustment (1-4 keys + arrows) should work silently without constant debug messages.
