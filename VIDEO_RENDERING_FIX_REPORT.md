# Video Rendering Fix - Implementation Report

## Problem
The main video content was not visible in the OpenGL video player, even though all overlay elements (borders, corners, help text) were displaying correctly.

## Solution Implemented
We applied a comprehensive fix to the `gl_render_frame` function in `gl_context.c` that addressed several potential issues causing the video rendering problem:

1. **Complete OpenGL State Reset**:
   - Added a complete buffer unbinding step before setting up the rendering state
   - Reset all vertex attribute arrays
   - Cleared active shader program with `glUseProgram(0)`

2. **Explicit State Restoration**:
   - Set up correct vertex attributes with proper enables
   - Explicitly disabled blending (`glDisable(GL_BLEND)`)
   - Disabled depth testing (`glDisable(GL_DEPTH_TEST)`)

3. **Texture Parameter Reset**:
   - Added explicit texture parameter settings for all YUV textures
   - Set proper filtering (GL_LINEAR) and wrapping modes (GL_CLAMP_TO_EDGE)

4. **Enhanced Error Checking**:
   - Added error checking before and after the draw call
   - Improved error messages to help identify any remaining issues

## Testing
The fix was tested with the `test_white.mp4` file, and:
- The video now renders correctly in the player
- Frame timing reports indicate successful rendering
- No OpenGL errors were reported

## Technical Details
The root cause was likely OpenGL state corruption from the overlay rendering functions (border, corners, help text) that wasn't being fully reset before the main video rendering. The overlays were enabling blending and changing other state that affected the video visibility.

By completely resetting all OpenGL state before rendering the video and explicitly setting all required state values, we've ensured that the video rendering pipeline is independent of any state changes made by other rendering functions.

## Additional Notes
This fix ensures that:
1. The main video is visible
2. All overlay elements still work correctly
3. The keystone perspective correction continues to function

The log output confirms that the video data is being successfully uploaded to GPU textures and rendered without errors.
